# Pong
One of the very basic arcade games.
This game that I developed as a project is a 1-Player game, where we are the paddle on the left side.
The winning condition is simple, "first to score 3 wins."

# How to play
To play the game you just need to click the file and the game will run on your browser.

# Pong mechanics
This is a game coded in JavaScript with a basic AI. 
This is a project which will help you understand the 'Ball Physics' (this is what I like to call it), which includes the concept of knowing & coding the trajectory
in which the ball will bounce off, coding so that the ball can differentiate between player & non-player entities within the game.
I have added comments as well to the code, so that anyone who has not developed this game can understand why a particular line of code is included.

# My take from this project
Pong really helped me in Understanding and practicing these hands-on:
*Using JavaScript for game development
*Bouncing ball trajevtory
*Differentiating between player and non-player entities
*Importance of having different functions to make code easy to debug
